## Licensed Software

Paying for software can give you the tools you need, with a minimal amount of effort required to learn how to use and maintain them. Selecting the right set of software to pay for can save the most valuable thing you posess: :fontawesome-regular-hourglass-half: your time! 

### Geographic Information Systems

!!! Tip "ESRI Software"
      [ESRI's ArcGIS and ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html){target=_blank} are typically the first Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software taught to students at universities and community colleges. 
      
      ESRI products dominate the US market and are found in most government agencies. 
      
      [ESRI products are widely used in Incident Management for Wildland Fire](https://www.esri.com/en-us/industries/wildland-fire/overview){target=_blank} in the US.

      Access to ArcGIS requires an expensive software license agreement. Normally this cost is paid for by contracting agreements through your agency or local government. If you're working for a smaller agency or non-governmental organization, these costs can be prohibitive.

      ESRI products rely on open source software in some critical ways.

      ArcGIS does have a Python library, and can be used with [:simple-jupyter: Jupyter Notebooks](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/using-the-jupyter-notebook-environment/){target=_blank}
