## :material-license: Licensed Software

??? Tip "Why pay for software?"
      
      Paying for software can give you the tools you need, with a minimal amount of effort required to learn how to use and maintain them. Selecting the right set of software to pay for can save the most valuable thing you posess: :fontawesome-regular-hourglass-half: your time!

      That being said, expensive licensed software are often not available to international researchers from the Global South or underserved communities or institutions. 

### :material-layers-triple-outline: Geographic Information Systems

??? Tip "How I learned to stop worrying, and love the ArcGIS :bomb:"

      [ESRI's ArcGIS and ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html){target=_blank} are typically the first Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software taught to students at universities and community colleges. 
      
      ESRI products dominate the US market and are found in most government agencies. 
      
      ESRI products are widely used in [wildland fire incident management](https://www.esri.com/en-us/industries/wildland-fire/overview){target=_blank} (in the US).

      [WFDSS NIFC ArcGIS](https://nifc.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8e2b29eb0ae04e73801b08314b395b94)

      Access to ArcGIS requires an expensive software license agreement. Normally this cost is paid for by contracting agreements through your agency or local government. If you're working for a smaller agency or non-governmental organization, these costs can be prohibitive.

      ESRI's software products do rely on open source software like [GDAL](https://gdal.org/software_using_gdal.html), and Python which can be used with [:simple-jupyter: Jupyter Notebooks](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/using-the-jupyter-notebook-environment/){target=_blank}
