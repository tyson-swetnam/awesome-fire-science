## Cyberinfrastructure

"Cyberinfrastructure" is a term used in academic settings to describe computational resources. "Cloud" is now the dominant paradigm for working with computational data but the cyberinfrastructure term also includes high throughput and high performance computing (HTC/HPC) resources which are commonly found at large government labs and research universities. 

### Public Cloud

Existing investments in research cyberinfrastructure are available for free to all US based researchers. These resources can be used by non-US researchers under certain conditions. 

[ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/){target=_blank} - NSF supported cyberinfrastructure network (HPC, HTC, research clouds)

[Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/){target=_blank} - NSF supported cyberinfrastructure (cloud), managed through ACCESS

[CyVerse](https://cyverse.org){target=_blank} - NSF supported cyberinfrastructure for life sciences

#### Public Workbenches

[CyberGIS](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/){target=_blank} - HPC and Cloud service for geospatial data anlayses

[CyVerse Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org/){target=_blank} - multi-platform service for full-stack cloud data management 

[DesignSafe CI](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/){target=_blank} - workbench for natural hazards research.

[Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://earthengine.google.com/){target=_blank} - planetary-scale platform for Earth science data & analysis.   

[HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org/){target=_blank} - platform for hydrological science applications supported by CUAHSI 

[Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/){target=_blank} - Microsoft Azure compute environment (JupyterHub) with PANGEO software.  

[OSF.io](https://osf.io/){target=_blank} - is a free, open source web application that connects and supports the research workflow, enabling scientists to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their research.

### Commercial Cloud 

Commercial cloud resources are available to all at a $$$.

   * [Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/higher-education/academic-research){target=_blank} - free credits for research on Microsoft Azure
   * [Google Cloud](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/research/?modal_active=none){target=_blank} - free credits for research on Google Cloud
   * [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/cloud-credit-for-research/){target=_blank} - free credits for research on Amazon Web Services

#### Development Environments

Development Environments are virtual machines which use containers to give users a fresh software environment on-demand. 

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){target=_blank} - Google's CoLaboratory starts a Jupyter Notebook, limited in size but can be increased with subscription.                

[CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces){target=_blank} - GitHub's CodeSpaces starts a VS Code instance from a GitHub Repository which can be variabily sized (requires subscription)      

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/){target=_blank} - starts a VS Code instance that can be variably sized 

[MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/){target=_blank} - starts a defined environment (RStudio, Jupyter, VS Code) from a GitHub Repository, limited in size.
