## :material-layers-triple-outline: CyberGIS

There are numerous platforms available online for running computaitonal analyses (models), or for viewing public data sets.

#### :simple-googleearth: Google Earth Engine

All major Earth Observation System (EOS) datasets (e.g. ESA, NASA) are available on commercial cloud 

[:simple-googleearth: Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/){target=_blank} is the most widel used cyberGIS for analysing EOS data.

#### :simple-microsoft: Microsoft Planetary Computer

Microsoft has just launched a sort-of-competitor to GEE called [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/){target=_blank}. 

Planeteray computer is based on the Python language and supports Project Jupyter and distributed computing across Azure.
